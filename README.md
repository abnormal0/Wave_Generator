# *Wave_Generator*
*This is a class project of the application of FPGA.*  
*Chip type: Xilinx xc7a35tftg256.*  
## *Main Function*
*1. Generate the sine, triangle and square waves.*  
*2. The frequency of waves is controlled by 8 bit USART, form 0Hz - 255Hz.*  
*3. The amplitude of waves is controlled by 4 switches, from 0V to 1V whose resolution is 0.1V.*  
*4. The choice of waves is controlled by 2 switches.*  
*5. The result of output can be shown by VGA, which can display the information about image of the cooresponding waves and the value of frequency and amplitude.*
